          </p>

          <p>
            Like many businesses, we also collect information through cookies

            The information we collect includes:

              Location Data. We collect location data such as information about your device's location, which can be
              either precise or imprecise. How much information we collect depends on the type and settings of the
              device you use to access the Services. For example, we may use GPS and other technologies to collect
              geolocation data that tells us your current location (based on your IP address). You can opt out of
              allowing us to collect this information either by refusing access to the information or by disabling your
              Location setting on your device. However, if you choose to opt out, you may not be able to use certain
              aspects of the Services.

          <p>In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your information
            without your consent, including, for example:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely
              way</li>
            <li>For investigations and fraud detection and prevention</li>
            <li>For business transactions provided certain conditions are met</li>
            <li>If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess, process, or settle
              an insurance claim</li>
            <li>For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin</li>
            <li>If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of financial abuse
            </li>
            <li>If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability or the
              accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a
              breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province</li>
            <li>If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court
              relating to the production of records</li>
            <li>If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business, or profession and the
              collection is consistent with the purposes for which the information was produced</li>
            <li>If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes</li>
            <li>If the information is publicly available and is specified by the regulations</li>
          </ul>

          <p>We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and pixels) to access or store

            is set out in our Cookie Notice.</p>

          <h4>6. HOW DO WE HANDLE YOUR SOCIAL LOGINS?</h4>

          <p>In Short: If you choose to register or log in to our Services using a social media account, we may have
            access to certain information about you.</p>

          <p>Our Services offer you the ability to register and log in using your third-party social media account
            details (like your Facebook or Twitter logins). Where you choose to do this, we will receive certain profile
            information about you from your social media provider. The profile information we receive may vary depending
            on the social media provider concerned, but will often include your name, email address, friends list, and
            profile picture, as well as other information you choose to make public on such a social media platform.</p>

          <p>We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are described in this privacy notice or
            that are otherwise made clear to you on the relevant Services. Please note that we do not control, and are
            not responsible for, other uses of your personal information by your third-party social media provider. We
            recommend that you review their privacy notice to understand how they collect, use, and share your personal
            information, and how you can set your privacy preferences on their sites and apps.</p>

          <h4>7. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h4>

          <p>In Short: We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this
            privacy notice unless otherwise required by law.</p>

          <p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this
            privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting,
            or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information
            for longer than three (3) months past the termination of the user's account. </p>

          <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either
            delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal
            information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and
            isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>

          <h4>8. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h4>

          <p>In Short: We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical

            protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to
            secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can
            be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other
            unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or
            modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of
            personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services
            within a secure environment.</p>

            you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to
            such minor dependent’s use of the Services. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18
            years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly
            delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data, we may have collected from children

            include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to request
            rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your personal information; (iv) if applicable,
            to data portability; and (v) not to be subject to automated decision-making. In certain circumstances, you

            request by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section "HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT

            be express and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have the right to withdraw your
            consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by using the contact details
            provided in the section "HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?" below.</p>

          <p>However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal nor,
            when applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance
            on lawful processing grounds other than consent.</p>

          <strong>Account Information</strong>

          <p>If you would at any time like to review or change the information in your account or terminate your

            problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our legal terms and/or comply with applicable legal
            requirements.</p>

          <p>Cookies and similar technologies: Most Web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer,
            you can usually choose to set your browser to remove cookies and to reject cookies. If you choose to remove
            cookies or reject cookies, this could affect certain features or services of our Services.</p>

          <p>If you have questions or comments about your privacy rights, you may email us at info@approveage.com.</p>

          <h4>11. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h4>

          <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT")
            feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online
            browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing
            and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals
            or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard
            for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in
            a revised version of this privacy notice.</p>
