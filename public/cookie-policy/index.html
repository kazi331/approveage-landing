          Policy explains how Approveage Inc. ("<strong>Company</strong>,"
          "<strong>we</strong>," "<strong>us</strong>," and
          "<strong>our</strong>") uses cookies and similar technologies to
          recognize you when you visit our website at
           <a href="https://www.approveage.com">https://www.approveage.com</a> ("Website"). It explains what these
          technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to
          control our use of them.
          </p>
          <p>
            In some cases, we may use cookies to collect personal information,
            or that becomes personal information if we combine it with other
            information.
          </p>

          <h4>What are cookies?</h4>

          <p>
            Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or
            mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by
            website owners in order to make their websites work, or to work
            more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.
          </p>

          <p>
            Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, Approveage) are
            called "first-party cookies." Cookies set by parties other than
            the website owner are called "third-party cookies." Third-party
            cookies enable third-party features or functionality to be
            provided on or through the website (e.g., advertising, interactive
            content, and analytics). The parties that set these third-party
            cookies can recognize your computer both when it visits the
            website in question and also when it visits certain other
            websites.
          </p>

          <h4>Why do we use cookies?</h4>

          <p>
            We use first- and third-party cookies for several reasons. Some
            cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our
            website to operate, and we refer to these as "essential" or
            "strictly necessary" cookies. Other cookies also enable us to
            track and target the interests of our users to enhance the
            experience on our Online Properties. Third parties serve cookies
            through our website for advertising, analytics, and other
            purposes. This is described in more detail below.
          </p>

          <h4>How can I control cookies?</h4>

          <p>
            You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies.
            You can exercise your cookie rights by setting your preferences in
            the Cookie Consent Manager. The Cookie Consent Manager allows you
            to select which categories of cookies you accept or reject.
            Essential cookies cannot be rejected as they are strictly
            necessary to provide you with services.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Cookie Consent Manager can be found in the notification banner
            and on our website. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still
            use our website though your access to some functionality and areas
            of our website may be restricted. You may also set or amend your
            web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies.
          </p>

          <p>
            The specific types of first- and third-party cookies served
            through our website and the purposes they perform are described in
            the table below (please note that the specific cookies served may
            vary depending on the specific Online Properties you visit):
          </p>

          <h4>Essential website cookies:</h4>

          <p>
            These cookies are strictly necessary to provide you with services
            available through our website and to use some of its features,
            such as access to secure areas.

          <h4>How can I control cookies on my browser?</h4>

          <p>
            As the means by which you can refuse cookies through your web
            browser controls vary from browser to browser, you should visit
            your browser's help menu for more information. The following is
            information about how to manage cookies on the most popular
            browsers:
          </p>
          <ul class="common-list">
            <li>Google Chrome</li>
            <li>Internet Explorer</li>
            <li>Firefox</li>
            <li>Safari</li>
            <li>Edge</li>
            <li>Opera</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            In addition, most advertising networks offer you a way to opt out
            of targeted advertising. If you would like to find out more
            information, please visit:

          <h4>What about other tracking technologies, like web beacons?</h4>
          <p>
            Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors to a
            website. We may use other, similar technologies from time to time,
            like web beacons (sometimes called "tracking pixels" or "clear
            gifs"). These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique
            identifier that enables us to recognize when someone has visited
            our website or opened an email including them. This allows us, for
            example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page
            within a website to another, to deliver or communicate with
            cookies, to understand whether you have come to the website from
            an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to
            improve site performance, and to measure the success of email
            marketing campaigns. In many instances, these technologies are
            reliant on cookies to function properly, and so declining cookies
            will impair their functioning.
          </p>

          <h4>Do you use Flash cookies or Local Shared Objects?</h4>

          <p>
            Websites may also use so-called "Flash Cookies" (also known as
            Local Shared Objects or "LSOs") to, among other things, collect
            and store information about your use of our services, fraud
            prevention, and for other site operations.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you do not want Flash Cookies stored on your computer, you can
            adjust the settings of your Flash player to block Flash Cookies
            storage using the tools contained in the <a href="https://macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html" target="_blank">
              Website Storage Settings
              Panel
            </a>. You can also control Flash Cookies by going to the <a href="https://macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html" target="_blank">
              Global
              Storage Settings Panel
            </a> and following the instructions (which may
            include instructions that explain, for example, how to delete
            existing Flash Cookies (referred to "information" on the
            Macromedia site), how to prevent Flash LSOs from being placed on
            your computer without your being asked, and (for Flash Player 8
            and later) how to block Flash Cookies that are not being delivered
            by the operator of the page you are on at the time).
          </p>

          <p>
            Please note that setting the Flash Player to restrict or limit
            acceptance of Flash Cookies may reduce or impede the functionality
            of some Flash applications, including, potentially, Flash
            applications used in connection with our services or online
            content.
          </p>

          <h4>Do you serve targeted advertising?</h4>

          <p>
            Third parties may serve cookies on your computer or mobile device
            to serve advertising through our website. These companies may use
            information about your visits to this and other websites in order
            to provide relevant advertisements about goods and services that
            you may be interested in. They may also employ technology that is
            used to measure the effectiveness of advertisements. They can
            accomplish this by using cookies or web beacons to collect
            information about your visits to this and other sites in order to
            provide relevant advertisements about goods and services of
            potential interest to you. The information collected through this
            process does not enable us or them to identify your name, contact
            details, or other details that directly identify you unless you
            choose to provide these.
          </p>

          <h4>How often will you update this, Cookie Policy?</h4>

          <p>
            We may update this Cookie Policy from time to time in order to
            reflect, for example, changes to the cookies we use or for other
            operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. Please therefore
            revisit this Cookie Policy regularly to stay informed about our
            use of cookies and related technologies.
          </p>

          <p>
            The date at the top of this Cookie Policy indicates when it was
            last updated.
